Thank you Nikola for your helpful tutorials as well as your open code. He has some high quality tutorials on getting
started with the MEAN statck (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). Having only little javascript exprience, with zero
experience with and of the components of this stack, I found it quitevaluable to get a kick start and actually begin
developing the game. Check out his website at www.nikola-breznjak.com.
